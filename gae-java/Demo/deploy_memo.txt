<1> Use recent version Eclipse
  - Eclipse Neo causes Java version issue. It only accepts ~1.7
  - Market Place -> Search "Google Cloud" -> File/Sign in Google
<2> Deploy
  - Much easier in recent version Eclipse. Just create a GAE project and right click and deploy.
  - Old versions = project ID at <application/> of appengine-web.xml
